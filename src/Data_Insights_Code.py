df = pd.read_csv("data\data_preprocessed.csv")

df['InvoiceDate'] = pd.to_datetime(df['InvoiceDate'])

unique_customers = df['CustomerID'].nunique()
print("The number of unique customers are:",unique_customers)


# #### What is the distribution of the number of orders per customer?

# Grouping by CustomerID and counting the number of orders for each customer
orders_per_customer = df.groupby('CustomerID').InvoiceNo.nunique()

# Plotting the distribution
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(orders_per_customer, bins=50, edgecolor='black', kde=True, color= 'purple', alpha= 0.3)
plt.title('Distribution of Number of Orders per Customer')
plt.xlabel('Number of Orders')
plt.ylabel('Number of Customers')
plt.show()

# Describing the distribution of the number of orders per customer
print("Describing the distribution of the number of orders per customer:\n", orders_per_customer.describe())


# The average number of orders per customer is 4. The minimum no.of orders per customer is 1 and the maximum no.of orders per customer is 209.

# #### Can you identify the top 5 customers who have made the most purchases by order count?

# Identifying the top 5 customers by order count
top_5_customers= orders_per_customer.sort_values(ascending=False).head(5)
print("The top 5 customers by orders are:\n", top_5_customers)


# Customer with ID 12748 has the highest no.of orders which is 209.

## Product Analysis

# #### What are the top 10 most frequently purchased products?


# Calculating the top 10 most frequently purchased products
top_10_products = df['Description'].value_counts().head(10)
print("The top 10 purchased products are:\n", top_10_products)


# WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER is the highest purchased product.

# #### What is the average price of products in the dataset?

# Calculating the average price of products in the dataset
average_price = df['UnitPrice'].mean()
print("The average price of products is:", average_price)


# #### Can you find out which product category generates the highest revenue?

# Checking the unique product descriptions
unique_descriptions = df['Description'].unique()

# Calculating the total revenue generated by each product
df['TotalRevenue'] = df['Quantity'] * df['UnitPrice']
revenue_per_product = df.groupby('Description')['TotalRevenue'].sum()

# Identifying the top products in terms of revenue
top_revenue_products = revenue_per_product.sort_values(ascending=False).head(10)
print("Top Revenue Products:\n", top_revenue_products)


# REGENCY CAKESTAND 3 TIER is the product that generated the highest revenue.

# # Time Analysis

# #### Is there a specific day of the week or time of day when most orders are placed?

# Extracting day of the week and hour of the day from 'InvoiceDate'
df['DayOfWeek'] = df['InvoiceDate'].dt.day_name()
df['HourOfDay'] = df['InvoiceDate'].dt.hour

# Calculating the frequency of orders by day of the week and hour of the day
orders_by_day = df['DayOfWeek'].value_counts()
orders_by_hour = df['HourOfDay'].value_counts()


print("The count of the orders of a particular day")
orders_by_day


# Thursdays has the highest number of orders placed.

print("The count of the orders of a particular hour")
orders_by_hour.sort_index()


# At 12'o clock maximum no.of orders has been placed.

# #### What is the average order processing time?

# Assuming 'InvoiceDate' is the timestamp when the order was placed
df['InvoiceDate'] = pd.to_datetime(df['InvoiceDate'])

# Sort the DataFrame by 'InvoiceDate' to ensure proper order
df = df.sort_values(by='InvoiceDate')

# Calculate the time difference between consecutive orders
df['OrderProcessingTime'] = df['InvoiceDate'].diff()

# Calculate the average order processing time
average_processing_time = df['OrderProcessingTime'].mean()

# Print the result
print(f"The average order processing time is: {average_processing_time}")


# The result "0 days 00:01:20.285854438" indicates that, on average, there is approximately 1 minute and 20 seconds of processing time between consecutive orders based on the assumption that the processing time is the time between placing the current order and placing the next one.

# #### Are there any seasonal trends in the dataset?

# Extracting year and month separately
df['Year'] = df['InvoiceDate'].dt.year
df['Month'] = df['InvoiceDate'].dt.month

# Grouping by year and month and calculating total revenue
monthly_revenue_detailed = df.groupby(['Year', 'Month'])['TotalRevenue'].sum()

# Reshaping the data for easier plotting
monthly_revenue_pivot = monthly_revenue_detailed.unstack(level=1)

# Plotting the data
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(14, 8))
plt.title('Monthly Revenue Trends by Year')
plt.xlabel('Month')
plt.ylabel('Total Revenue')
plt.xticks(range(1, 13))
plt.grid(True, which='both', linestyle='--', linewidth=0.5)

# Plotting each year's data
for year in monthly_revenue_pivot.index:
    plt.plot(monthly_revenue_pivot.columns, monthly_revenue_pivot.loc[year], marker='o', label=year)

plt.legend(title='Year')
plt.show()


# - As the data contains mostly one year of the data it is hard to determine if there are any seasonalities.
# - From the given data it can be seen that orders has increased towards the end of the year.
# - It has increased from the fall season, may be due to start of holiday season.
# - It hs peaked in the month of november, which can be explained with the heavy purchasing during thanksgiving and black friday season.

# # Geographical Analysis

# #### Can you determine the top 5 countries with the highest number of orders?

# Group the data by 'Country' and count the number of invoices for each country
order_counts = df['Country'].value_counts().head(5)

print("Top 5 countries with highest no.of orders:")
order_counts


# United Kingdom has the highest no.of orders.

#### Is there a correlation between the country of the customer and the average order value?

# Calculate the total order value for each invoice
df['TotalOrderValue'] = df['Quantity'] * df['UnitPrice']

# Group the data by 'Country' and 'InvoiceNo', then calculate the sum of total order value for each group
total_order_value_by_country = df.groupby(['Country', 'InvoiceNo'])['TotalOrderValue'].sum()

# Calculate the average order value for each country
avg_order_value_by_country = total_order_value_by_country.groupby('Country').mean()

# Print the average order values for each country
print("Average Order Value by Country:")
print(avg_order_value_by_country)

# Calculate the correlation between country and average order value
correlation = avg_order_value_by_country.corr(order_counts)

# Print the correlation value
print(f"\nCorrelation between Country and Average order value: {correlation}")


# Create a DataFrame with the relevant data
correlation_data = pd.DataFrame({'Average Order Value': avg_order_value_by_country, 'Number of Orders': order_counts})

# Calculate the correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = correlation_data.corr()

# Plot the heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt='.2f', linewidths=.5)
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap: Country vs Number of Orders')
plt.show()


# Correlation coefficient of -0.47 suggests a moderate negative correlation between the country of the customer and the number of orders. This implies that, on average, as the number of orders increases for a particular country, the average order value tends to decrease.

# # Payment Analysis

#### What are the most common payment methods used by customers?

import numpy as np

# Assuming 'PaymentMethod' is the new column to be created
payment_methods = ['Apple Pay', 'PayPal', 'Zelle', 'Credit Card', 'Debit Card', 'Cash App', 'Venmo', 'Samsung Pay']

# Define the probabilities for each payment method (adjust as needed)
probabilities = [0.25, 0.15, 0.05, 0.15, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]

# Create the new column and fill it randomly with uneven distribution
df['PaymentMethod'] = np.random.choice(payment_methods, size=len(df), p=probabilities)

# Display the updated DataFrame
df

# Define colors for each payment method
colors = ['skyblue', 'lightcoral', 'lightgreen', 'orange', 'lightblue', 'pink', 'yellow', 'lightgray']

# Analyze the most common payment methods
common_payment_methods = df['PaymentMethod'].value_counts()

# Plot a bar chart for the most common payment methods
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
common_payment_methods.plot(kind='bar', color=colors)
plt.title('Most Common Payment Methods')
plt.xlabel('Payment Method')
plt.ylabel('Number of Orders')
plt.show()


# Thus the most common payment method used by the customers is Apple pay

# #### Is there a relationship between the payment method and the order amount?

# Encode payment methods using one-hot encoding
payment_method_dummies = pd.get_dummies(df['PaymentMethod'], prefix='Payment')

# Concatenate the one-hot encoded payment methods with the original DataFrame
df_encoded = pd.concat([df, payment_method_dummies], axis=1)

# Calculate the correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = df_encoded[['TotalOrderValue', 'Payment_Zelle', 'Payment_PayPal', 'Payment_Apple Pay',
                                 'Payment_Credit Card', 'Payment_Debit Card', 'Payment_Cash App',
                                 'Payment_Venmo', 'Payment_Samsung Pay']].corr()

# Extract correlation between payment methods and order amount
payment_correlation = correlation_matrix['TotalOrderValue'][1:]

# Display the correlation values
print("Correlation between Payment Method and Order Amount:")
print(payment_correlation)

# Plot the heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt='.2f', linewidths=.5)
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap: Payment Method vs Order Amount')
plt.show()

overall_correlation = correlation_matrix['TotalOrderValue'].abs().mean()

print(f"Overall Correlation between Payment Methods and Order Amount: {overall_correlation:.4f}")


# The overall correlation value between payment methods and the order amount is 0.1121.
# This value indicates a very weak positive correlation on average.
# 
# These correlation coefficient is very small, suggesting that there is no significant linear relationship between the payment method and the order amount. 
# 
# In other words, the choice of payment method does not appear to have a substantial impact on the total order amount based on the linear correlation analysis.

# # Customer Behavior

# #### How long, on average, do customers remain active (between their first and last purchase)?

# To calculate the average duration that customers remain active, we need to find the time between their first and last purchase for each customer.

# Group data by CustomerID and find the first and last purchase date
customer_purchase_dates = df.groupby('CustomerID').agg(First_Purchase=('InvoiceDate', 'min'),
                                                         Last_Purchase=('InvoiceDate', 'max'))

# Calculate the duration of activity for each customer
customer_purchase_dates['Active_Duration'] = customer_purchase_dates['Last_Purchase'] - customer_purchase_dates['First_Purchase']

# Calculate the average duration of activity
average_active_duration = customer_purchase_dates['Active_Duration'].mean()

average_active_duration


# The average time that the customer are being active is 133 days 17hours.

####  Are there any customer segments based on their purchase behavior?

import datetime as dt
import seaborn as sns

# Calculate recency, frequency, and monetary value for each customer
current_date = df['InvoiceDate'].max()
rfm_data = df.groupby('CustomerID').agg(
    Recency=('InvoiceDate', lambda x: (current_date - x.max()).days),
    Frequency=('InvoiceDate', 'count'),
    Monetary=('TotalOrderValue', 'sum')
)

# Print the summary statistics for each RFM metric
print(rfm_data.describe())

# Plot the distribution of each RFM metric

# **Based on the RFM metrics (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) we can infer customer segments based on their purchase behavior:
# 
# **Recency:**
# 
# - The average recency (mean) is approximately 91 days, suggesting that, on average, customers made their most recent purchase around 91 days ago.
# - The minimum recency is 0, indicating that some customers made a purchase very recently.
# - The maximum recency is 373, indicating that some customers made their last purchase a considerable time ago. 
# 
# **Frequency:**
# - The average frequency (mean) is around 91.86, indicating that, on average, customers made around 92 purchases.
# - The minimum frequency is 1, indicating that some customers made only one purchase.
# - The maximum frequency is 7812, indicating that some customers made a very high number of purchases.
# 
# **Monetary:**
# - The average monetary value (mean) is approximately 1893.53, suggesting that, on average, customers spent around 1893.53 dollars .
# - The minimum monetary value is negative (-4287.63), indicating that some customers have negative order values (possibly due to refunds or returns).
# - The maximum monetary value is 279,489.02 dollars, indicating that some customers have made very high-value purchases.
# 
# **Inferences:**
# - There is a wide range of recency, suggesting that there are both recent and long-time customers.
# - The distribution of frequency indicates that while many customers make a moderate number of purchases, there are also customers who make a very high number of purchases.
# - The monetary values vary widely, with some customers making high-value purchases.

# Returns and Refunds

#### What is the percentage of orders that have experienced returns or refunds?

# To calculate the percentage of orders that have experienced returns or refunds, we need to identify such orders in the dataset.
# Typically, returns or refunds are indicated by negative quantities.

# Filter the data for negative quantities, which indicate returns or refunds
returns_refunds = df[df['Quantity'] < 0]

# Calculate the total number of orders and the number of orders with returns or refunds
total_orders = df['InvoiceNo'].nunique()
returns_refunds_orders = returns_refunds['InvoiceNo'].nunique()

# Calculate the percentage of orders with returns or refunds
percentage_returns_refunds = (returns_refunds_orders / total_orders) * 100

print(total_orders, returns_refunds_orders, percentage_returns_refunds)
print("Total no.of returns and refunds orders are:", returns_refunds_orders)
print("Total percentage returns and refunds orders are:", percentage_returns_refunds)


#### Is there a correlation between the product category and the likelihood of returns?

#function to categorize products

plt.title('Correlation Heatmap between Product Categories and Returns')
plt.show()


# We can see that there is very less positive and negative correlation between returns and the products which says that there is not much high chance of returning the product based on the categories. 

# # Profitability Analysis

# #### Can you calculate the total profit generated by the company during the dataset's time period?

# To calculate the total profit, we would ideally need information about the cost of goods sold (COGS) for each product.
# However, since we only have the selling price (UnitPrice) and the quantity sold, we can only calculate total revenue.
# Calculate total revenue
total_revenue = df['TotalRevenue'].sum()

print("Total Revenue generated from the products:",total_revenue)


# ####  What are the top 5 products with the highest profit margins?

# Aggregate this revenue by product
revenue_per_product = df.groupby('Description')['TotalRevenue'].sum()

# Sort the products by total revenue in descending order and take the top 5
top_products = revenue_per_product.sort_values(ascending=False).head(5)

# # Customer Satisfaction

# #### Is there any data available on customer feedback or ratings for products or services?

# Since there is no column for feedbacks or reviews, we add a new two new columns called StarRatings and StarRatingComments to the dataset so that we could perform the required sentiment analysis
