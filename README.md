# Introduction
For any business, understanding customer behavior and product sales is crucial for survival and success, whether it operates online or has a physical location. Utilized VS code and Python to help an online retail business increase its revenue and profit margin by providing valuable insights through customer segmentation and an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on the dataset. We obtained the dataset from a Kaggle notebook sourced through the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
  
Analyzing customer data is crucial for businesses to identify the most suitable target audience for different advertising strategies. To begin with, we sorted the data and conducted an RFM analysis, which helped us extract valuable insights into the ideal customer base. We analyzed their activity time, purchase frequency, and spending patterns to identify the most relevant customer groups. Finally, assigned each group an RFM score based on the above parameters and determined the appropriate approach. 
  
Meticulously cleaned and prepared the dataset obtained from the Kaggle notebook to complete this project analysis. Additionally, we have followed a structured and reliable method for exploring the dataset using Python's Pandas library on the Jupyter Notebook platform. Our ultimate goal is to offer comprehensive and actionable insights on marketing and advertising strategies to help the business increase profitability and achieve overall success.

The customer dataset in the analysis was obtained from a Kaggle notebook sourced through the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains information on various products, their cost and description, quantity purchased, customer ID, and country of purchase. The initial exploration of the dataset involved: 
-	checking and converting data types 
-	checking for and removing null values 
-	dropping duplicate rows 
-	feature extraction and clustering 
-	recency, frequency, and monetary calculations 
The dataset provides valuable insights on when the customer had purchased the order and the number of orders placed which allows us to perform an RFM analysis with ease and create customer segmentation based on that analysis.
